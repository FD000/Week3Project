# Business Site

A tour agency webpage where customer can fill in their contact details if they woud like to travel to Afghanistan with our tour agency.

## The problem

The webpage is divided in three parts, 1) HTML, 2) CSS and 3) JavaScript. HTML and CSS was used to build and design the webpage and JS was used to make the FAQ section to dropdown Q&A section. I didn't face so much problem during this project, but I have now fully understand and learned why we always have to start to build our webpage looking from a mobile device point of view.
